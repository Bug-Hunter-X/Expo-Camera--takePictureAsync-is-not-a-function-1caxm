This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` function before the camera has fully initialized.  It manifests as an error message similar to `Camera.takePictureAsync is not a function`. The root cause is a race condition where the component tries to use the camera before the `Camera` component's `onCameraReady` callback has fired.
